# Golang microservices with hexagonal architecture

Importance had to be given to the structure of the project and design of the packages. The correctness of algorithms comes second in relation to API design and idiomatic golang.

The code should be easy to understand and maintain for other developers. I focused on writing my best code, and tried not to overengineer.

Ð¡ode structure should follow microservices best practices.

## Goals

- use of clean code, which is self documenting
- use of packages to achieve separation of concerns
- use of domain driven design
- use of golang idiomatic principles
- use of docker
- tests for business logic
- use of code quality checks such as linters and build tools
- use of git with appropriate commit messages
- documentation: README and inline code comments
- use go modules and a version of go >= 1.19
